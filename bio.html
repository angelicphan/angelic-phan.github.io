            <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
            <p>
              I Graduated from Portland State University in March of 2020 with a
              B.S. in Computer Science, Magna Cum Laude. Currently, I am looking
              for a full-time position as a Software Developer. I am eager to
              learn and try out new things, am always a team player, strives to
              do my best, and am never afraid to ask questions. If I do not
              understand something or am stuck, I will try my best to figure it
              out, but I won't hesitate to seek help from my fellow collegues if
              I can.
            </p>

          <div class="bio-text">
            <h4>SKILLS</h4>
            <p>
              Although I do not have much professional working experience, I
              have experience in the following:
              <li>
                <i>Languages:</i> C++, C, Java, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, jQuery, Git ...
              </li>
              <li>
                <i>Systems/Frameworks:</i> Linux/Unix, Node, Django, PostgreSQL,
                SQLite3, MongoDB, Bootstrap ...
              </li>
              <li>
                <i>Tools:</i> Github, Atom, VS Code, IntelliJ, Postman ...
              </li>
            </p>
            <p>
              I am most experienced in creating programs in Linux/Unix with
              languages such as C++ and Java. I have recently been involved in
              projects pertaining to web app development and databases, and
              enjoy learning about game development, but I am also interested in
              exploring about other types of software development.

            <h4>GOALS</h4>
            <p>
              At the moment, my goals are to find a job that I will enjoy doing.
              A working environment that fosters growth, creativity, and pride
              in what we do. Because I know that I am not perfect, and that
              there is much for me to learn, I want to gain the necessary skills
              and experience that will take me further and open up new
              possibilities. I want to be challenged to do better and be better.
              I want to contribute to projects that either help others or bring
              joy to them. Useful technologies that we enjoy making and others
              enjoy using.
